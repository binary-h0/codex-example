# Service Overview

A unified developer productivity platform leveraging Codex-CLI and GitHub Actions to automate code review, testing, documentation, and release workflows. Tailored outputs for technical (Developers, QA) and non-technical (Product Managers, Stakeholders) roles.

## Pipeline Triggering Mechanisms

Users can invoke and control the GitHub Actions workflows through various triggers to best fit their development process:

* **Automatic Triggers**:

  * **push**: Any code push to designated branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`, feature branches) kicks off the full pipeline or targeted stages.
  * **pull_request**: Opening or updating a PR triggers code analysis, testing, and quality checks.
  * **schedule**: Nightly or weekly scheduled runs (cron) generate project health reports and trend analytics for PMs.
  * **release**: Tag creation or merge to release branches invokes release notes drafting and documentation tasks.

* **Manual Triggers**:

  * **workflow_dispatch**: Developers or PMs can manually dispatch workflows from the Actions tab, specifying parameters such as the target branch, environment, or custom analysis depth.
  * **repository_dispatch**: External tools or bots (e.g., chatbots) can send custom events to start specific jobs (e.g., on-demand sprint reports).

* **Label-Based Triggers**:

  * Applying labels such as `run-tests`, `draft-release`, or `regen-docs` to issues or PRs triggers corresponding job subsets, giving fine-grained control without code changes.

* **Comment-Based Triggers**:

  * Slash commands in PR comments (e.g., `/run full-analysis`, `/rerun tests`) invoke specified jobs dynamically via the GitHub Actions comment workflow.

## 1. Automated Code Analysis & Summaries

### 1.1. Pull Request Analysis

* **Trigger**: `pull_request` or manual `workflow_dispatch` with event `code-analysis`.
* **Process**:

  * Codex-CLI analyzes diffs to:

    * Identify high-risk changes (security, performance, style violations).
    * Highlight missing test coverage or potential logic gaps.
  * Generate a structured summary:

    * **Changed modules/files** with line counts.
    * **Key semantic changes** (e.g., API signature updates, algorithm modifications).
    * **Risk flags** (e.g., SQL injection, unhandled exceptions).
* **Developer Output**: Inline comments in PR, Markdown summary in CI status.
* **PM/Stakeholder Output**: Consolidated “Change Overview” email or dashboard card:

  * Bullet list of major change categories.
  * Impact assessment (e.g., core vs. peripheral).

### 1.2. Project-Wide Reports for PMs

* **Triggers**:

  * Scheduled `cron` runs (e.g., daily at 00:00 UTC).
  * On-demand via `/generate-report` slash command (repository_dispatch).
* **Content**:

  * **Recent PRs**: Titles, authors, summaries.
  * **Trend Analytics**: Number of PRs, average review time, common issues.
  * **Action Items**: High-priority flagged PRs needing cross-team coordination.

## 2. Automated Testing & Reporting

### 2.1. CI Test Execution

* **Trigger**: `push`, `pull_request`, or manual `workflow_dispatch` with event `test-run`.
* **Process**: GitHub Actions runs unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in a parallel matrix.
* **Codex-CLI Analysis**:

  * Summarizes pass/fail rates.
  * Identifies flaky tests by comparing historical runs.
  * Suggests probable root causes by parsing failure logs (e.g., timeout, assertion errors).

### 2.2. Delivery Channels

* **Slack**: Ephemeral messages or channel notifications with failure diagnostics and rerun links.
* **Email Digest**: Configurable daily or post-PR summary to PMs/QAs:

  * New failures, resolved incidents, SLA adherence metrics.

### 2.3. Next-Step Recommendations

* **Trigger**: Immediately after test analysis.
* **Codex-CLI** suggests:

  * **Fixes**: Example code snippets for null checks or boundary validations.
  * **Test Enhancements**: Identify untested paths with sample test templates.

---

## 3. Code Quality Checks & Linting

### 3.1. Static Analysis

* **Trigger**: `push`, `pull_request`, or label `run-quality`.
* **Process**:

  * Run ESLint, Pylint, SonarQube scans.
  * Codex-CLI groups findings by severity and generates refactoring recommendations (e.g., extract methods, reduce complexity).

### 3.2. Quality Dashboards

* **Developer View**: Inline annotations and status check in PR.
* **PM View**: Weekly scheduled dashboard update:

  * Trend chart of new vs. resolved issues.
  * Areas with rising cyclomatic complexity or code smells.

---

## 4. Automated Release Notes

### 4.1. Aggregation

* **Trigger**: `release` event (tag push) or merge into `release/*` branches.
* **Process**:

  * Codex-CLI gathers closed PR summaries and linked issue metadata (bug, enhancement).

### 4.2. Draft Generation

* **Output**:

  * Markdown draft with sections for **New Features**, **Bug Fixes**, **Breaking Changes**, **Improvements**.
  * Hyperlinks to PR/Issue numbers and templated placeholders for Known Issues.

### 4.3. Publication Workflow

* **Trigger**: Approval of the release note PR.
* **Process**: Automated merge, version bump, and changelog publication.

---

## 5. Documentation Support

### 5.1. Change Detection

* **Trigger**: `push`, `pull_request`, or slash command `/regen-docs`.
* **Process**: Monitor diffs in code comments, README, API specs and detect new or updated endpoints.

### 5.2. Doc Drafting

* **Codex-CLI** generates:

  * **Usage Examples** from code samples and tests.
  * **Parameter & Return Definitions**.
  * **Migration Guides** for deprecated APIs.

### 5.3. Delivery

* **Trigger**: Automatic PR creation against `docs/` on draft completion.
* **Process**: Notify technical writers via Slack or email with review links.

---

## 6. Feature Flags & Deployment Status

### 6.1. Deployment Summaries

* **Trigger**: `deployment` or merge to `main`/`staging` branches.
* **Process**:

  * Capture environment, cluster, version, and feature flag states via GitHub Actions and feature-flag API.

### 6.2. Notifications & Dashboards

* **Slack**: Deployment cards with environment links and active flags.
* **PM Portal**: Real-time widget showing latest deploys, uptime, rollback options.

### 6.3. Rollback & Feature Control

* **Trigger**: Manual `workflow_dispatch` for rollback or flag toggle.
* **Codex-CLI** recommends disabling flags based on anomaly detection in logs/metrics.

---

**Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Security**: All communications authenticated via GitHub OAuth; logs encrypted at rest.
* **Scalability**: Support large monorepos and >1000 PRs/month.
* **Extensibility**: Plugin hooks for custom linters, test suites, and notification channels.
* **Performance**: Complete analysis & reporting within 2 minutes per run.
